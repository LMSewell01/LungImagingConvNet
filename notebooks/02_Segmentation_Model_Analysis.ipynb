The model learns to predict the absence of COVID-19, which is correct for most images, but does not mean it is good at segmenting actual COVID-19 regions. This highlights the need for careful metric interpretation and possibly more balanced data or targeted evaluation.

Attempts to improve performance by unfreezing additional layers of the ResNet50 backbone did not yield significant improvements. These results suggest that further optimization of the segmentation model may not be feasible within the current resource and time constraints. As a result, it is necessary to reconsider the project's aim and scope, potentially shifting focus toward classification-based or hybrid approaches that are more practical given the limitations."

    "## Next Steps and Future Directions\n",

    "Based on the analysis of Iteration 3, several challenges remain for multi-class segmentation, particularly for the COVID-19 and non-COVID infection classes. Despite attempts to improve performance by introducing class weighting and unfreezing additional layers of the ResNet50 backbone, the model continued to struggle with segmenting rare and small mask regions. These approaches also significantly increased computational demands, making further optimization impractical given available resources and time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these limitations, the following paths forward were considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Shift to a Classification-Based Model - SELECTED PATH FORWARD\n",
    "\n",
    "- The segmentation model demonstrated strong ability to distinguish the presence or absence of COVID-19, but struggled with precise mask prediction for rare classes.\n",
    "- A classification-based approach is less computationally intensive and more feasible for deployment within current resource constraints.\n",
    "- This approach leverages the model's strength in identifying COVID-19 cases and provides a practical solution for clinical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Obtain More Granular Annotation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improving segmentation performance for non-COVID infections would require more detailed and specific mask annotations.\n",
    "- Sourcing or generating additional datasets with granular sub-masks for non-COVID infections would be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n",
    "- Given current constraints, this option was not pursued further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implement a Hybrid Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- A two-stage model could first classify images as Healthy, COVID-19, or Non-COVID.\n",
    "- If COVID-19 is detected, a secondary segmentation model could be triggered to provide detailed mask predictions.\n",
    "- This hybrid approach balances computational efficiency with the need for detailed analysis in complex cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "Due to the computational power and time required to further augment and annotate data, and the limited improvement seen with segmentation, it was decided to shift the project focus toward a classification-based model. This change in scope aims to deliver a practical and deployable solution within available resources, while still addressing the core clinical need. Notebook 03 details training of the classification model."
